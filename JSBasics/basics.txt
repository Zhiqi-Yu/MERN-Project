JavaScript Features

1. difference between JS and Java is 
    (1) we don't have class in JS, functions are the highest priority citizenship
    (2) JS doesn't have overloadding , just overriding

2. closure: inner function can remember and use variables from outer functions, So we can use closures to achieve encapsulation

3. currying: return a function in another function, and hange the function that originally accepted multiple parameters to a "function chain" 
that only accepts one parameter at a time. The meaning is to improve function reusability and flexibility.

4. hoisting: Variable and function declarations can be hoisted to the top of the scope during the JS compilation phase. 
    But only hoisting, no value assigned.

5. callback: a function can become a parameter of another function. Again, the meaning is to improve function reusability and flexibility.

6. call, apply, and bind
    they are all methods of the Function prototype object, which means every functions can use them.
    their meaning is to manually specify the direction of "this"
    the difference are 
        (1) call always used in the condition of normal parameters
        (2) apply used in array parameters
        (3) bind returns a new function and bind "this" with something all the time
